exports[`Method RouteMethods should throw an error if the endpoint does not have the corresponding method 1`] = `
"The endpoint assigned to the 'post' parameter must have at least this method in its specification.
This error should prevent mistakes during the development process.
Example:

new RouteMethods({
  post: endpointsFactory.build({
    methods: ['post', 'get', 'patch']
    // or method: 'post'
    ...
  })
});
"
