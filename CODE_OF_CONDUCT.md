# Code of Conduct for the Express Zod API Community

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/en),
licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

Our primary goal is to foster an inclusive, friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all
contributors, users, and participants in the Express Zod API project, regardless of gender,
sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religion.

A supplemental goal is to promote **open-source citizenship** by encouraging all participants to
understand the impact of their actions on the community and to actively counteract inequality and
abuses of power within our project spaces.

## Key Expectations for Participants

The Express Zod API community expects participants to:

- **Participate authentically and actively.** Your contributions should be genuine and made in good
  faith towards the project's goals.
- **Exercise consideration and respect** in your speech and actions within all project communications
  (e.g., GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, Discord/chat).
- **Attempt collaboration before conflict.** When disagreements arise, seek to understand different
  perspectives and find common ground respectfully before escalating.
- **Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.** This applies to all
  online interactions, written communication, and any in-person events related to the project.
- **Be mindful of your surroundings** in shared online spaces. If you notice a dangerous situation,
  someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project
  maintainers.

## Unacceptable Behaviors

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within the Express Zod API community:

- **Intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning speech or actions** by
  any participant in our community online or in any related context.
- **Harmful or prejudiced comments** related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, mental
  illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or
  other personal attributes.
- **Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images** in public online spaces (e.g., as profile
  pictures, in discussions).
- **Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following** of community members.
- **Harassing photography or recording** of in-person interactions without explicit consent.
- **Sustained disruption** of discussions, talks, or other online activities.
- **Inappropriate physical contact** (in in-person contexts).
- **Unwelcome sexual attention.** This includes sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching,
  groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.
- **Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviors.**

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any participant will not be tolerated.

- Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply **immediately**.
- If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers may take any action they
  deem appropriate, including a temporary ban, permanent expulsion from the community, or
  editing/deletion of offending content, without warning or refund (if applicable to any paid
  access/materials).

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to, or witness, unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify
the project maintainers as soon as possible.

**How to Report:**

- **For private and sensitive reports:** Contact the core maintainers directly via
  [email](https://github.com/RobinTail/express-zod-api/blob/master/express-zod-api/package.json#L14).
- **For less sensitive or public issues:** You may open a GitHub issue, but be mindful of privacy and
  consider if direct email is more appropriate.

Project maintainers will be available to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide
escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe. Your grievance
will be handled seriously and investigated according to existing project governing policies. We
respect concerns about false accusations and will handle them according to our project's dispute
resolution processes.
