# Changelog

## Version 8

### v8.3.1

- Clearer error message when using `z.date()` within I/O schema thrown by OpenAPI generator.

### v8.3.0

- Feature #600: Top level refinements.
  - Starting this version you can use the `.refine()` method on the `z.object()` of the input schema.
  - This feature might be useful, for example, when you have multiple optional properties on the top level, but at
    least one of them has to be specified.
  - Currently, only the refinements of `z.object()` are supported.
    - You can not combine it with `z.union()`, `z.intersetion()`, `z.discriminatedUnion()`, `.or()`, `.and()` yet.

```typescript
// example
import { z } from "express-zod-api";

const endpoint = endpointsFactory.build({
  input: z
    .object({
      email: z.string().email().optional(),
      id: z.string().optional(),
      otherThing: z.string().optional(),
    })
    .refine(
      (inputs) => Object.keys(inputs).length >= 1,
      "Please provide at least one property"
    ),
  // ...
});
```

### v8.2.1

- OpenAPI generator throws when attempting to use `z.file()` within input schema.

### v8.2.0

- Feature #637: endpoint short description (summary).
  - Added the ability to assign a `shortDescription` to endpoints.
  - One sentence of no more than 50 characters is implied.
  - This text is substituted into the `summary` property of the generated documentation.
  - Visualizers of the generated OpenAPI documentation nicely display this text on the same line as the endpoint path.
  - If a `shortDescription` is not specified, but a regular `description` is, then by default the `summary` will be
    generated from the `description` by trimming.
  - You can optionally disable this behavior with the new option `hasSummaryFromDescription` of the `OpenAPI` generator.

```typescript
const exampleEndpoint = yourEndpointsFactory.build({
  // ...
  description: "The detailed explanaition on what this endpoint does.",
  shortDescription: "Retrieves the user.",
});
```

### v8.1.0

- Feature #571: tagging the endpoints.
  - Good news dear community! You can now tag your endpoints using the new properties of the `.build()` method
    of the `EndpointsFactory`.
  - For your convenience and for the sake of Semantics, there are singular and plural properties: `tag` and `tags`.
  - By default, these properties allow any string, so in order to enforce restrictions and achieve the consistency
    across all endpoints, the possible tags should be declared in the configuration first and also a brand
    new `EndpointsFactory` instantiation approach is required.
  - The configuration has got a new `tags` property for declaring possible tags and their descriptions.
  - Tags are an important part of the generated documentation for the OpenAPI standard.
- The property `scopes` (introduced in v7.9.0) has got its singular variation `scope`.

```typescript
import {
  createConfig,
  EndpointsFactory,
  defaultResultHandler,
} from "express-zod-api";

const config = createConfig({
  // ..., use the simple or the advanced syntax:
  tags: {
    users: "Everything about the users",
    files: {
      description: "Everything about the files processing",
      url: "https://example.com",
    },
  },
});

// instead of defaultEndpointsFactory use the following approach:
const taggedEndpointsFactory = new EndpointsFactory({
  resultHandler: defaultResultHandler, // or use your custom one
  config,
});

const exampleEndpoint = taggedEndpointsFactory.build({
  // ...
  tag: "users", // or tags: ["users", "files"]
});
```

### v8.0.2

- `express` version is 4.18.2.
- `openapi3-ts` version is 3.1.0.

### v8.0.1

- `zod` version is 3.19.1.

### v8.0.0

- `winston` version is 3.8.2.
- This version is based on v8.0.0-beta3 and contains breaking changes from v8.0.0-beta1 and v8.0.0-beta2.
  Check out the explanation of these breaking changes below in order to migrate to v8.0.0.

### v8.0.0-beta3

- This version includes the fix from version 7.9.2.
- `zod` version is 3.19.0.

### v8.0.0-beta2

- **Breaking**: removing the signature deprecated in v7.6.1.
  - The argument of `EndpointsFactory::addMiddleware()` has to be the result of `createMiddleware()`.

### v8.0.0-beta1

- This version is based on v7.9.1.
- **Breaking**: Only the following Node versions are supported:
  - 14.17.0 and higher,
  - 16.10.0 and higher
  - 18.0.0 and higher.
- `openapi3-ts` version is 3.0.2.
- Supporting `jest` (optional peer dependency) version 29.x.

## Version 7

### v7.9.2

- Fixed issue #585 found and reported along with a suggested solution by [@rayzr522](https://github.com/rayzr522).
  - In case you need to `throw` within an `Endpoint`'s handler or a `Middleware`, consider
    [the best practice](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-throw-literal) of only
    throwing an `Error` or a _descendant_ that extends the `Error`.
  - You can also `import { createHttpError } from "express-zod-api"` and use it for that purpose.
  - However, this version fixes the issue caused by throwing something else.
  - In this case that entity will be stringified into a `.message` of `Error`.
  - The issue manifested itself as a positive API response without data.

```typescript
// reproduction example
const myEndpoint = defaultEndpointsFactory.build({
  method: "get",
  input: z.object({}),
  output: z.object({}),
  handler: async () => {
    throw "I'm not an Error";
  },
});
```

```json lines
// response before:
{"status":"success"}
// response after:
{"status":"error","error":{"message":"I'm not an Error"}}
```

### v7.9.1

- Minor refactoring in order to support the recently released Typescript 4.8.2.

### v7.9.0

- Feature #540, an addition to the [#523](#v770): OAuth2 authentication with scopes.
  - Middlewares utilizing the OAuth2 authentication (via `security` property) can now specify the information on their
    flows including scopes.
  - Endpoints utilizing those middlewares can now specify their `scopes`.

```typescript
import { createMiddleware, defaultEndpointsFactory, z } from "express-zod-api";

// example middleware
const myMiddleware = createMiddleware({
  security: {
    type: "oauth2",
    flows: {
      password: {
        tokenUrl: "https://some.url",
        scopes: {
          read: "read something", // scope: description
          write: "write something",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  input: z.object({}),
  middleware: async () => ({
    /* ... */
  }),
});

// example endpoint
const myEndpoint = defaultEndpointsFactory.addMiddleware(myMiddleware).build({
  scopes: ["write"], // <——
  method: "post",
  input: z.object({}),
  output: z.object({}),
  handler: async () => ({
    /* ... */
  }),
});
```

### v7.8.1

- This version should fix the issue #551:
  - Supporting the peer dependency for `jest` version 28.

### v7.8.0

- `zod` version 3.18.0.
  - There is a new feature — [branded types](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#brand).
  - `ZodBranded` is supported by OpenAPI generator.

### v7.7.0

- Feature #523: Ability to specify Security schemas of your Middlewares and depict the Authentication of your API.
  - OpenAPI generator now can depict the [Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) of your
    endpoints as a part of the generated documentation.
  - There is a new optional property `security` of `createMiddleware()`.
  - You can specify a single or several security schemas in that property.
  - For several security schemas `security` support a new `LogicalContainer` that can contain upto 2 nested levels.
  - Supported security types: `basic`, `bearer`, `input`, `header`, `cookie`, `openid` and `oauth2`.
  - OpenID and OAuth2 security types are currently have the limited support: without scopes.

```typescript
// example middleware
import { createMiddleware } from "express-zod-api";

const authMiddleware = createMiddleware({
  security: {
    // requires the "key" in inputs and a custom "token" headers
    and: [
      { type: "input", name: "key" },
      { type: "header", name: "token" },
    ],
  },
  input: z.object({
    key: z.string().min(1),
  }),
  middleware: async ({ input: { key }, request }) => {
    if (key !== "123") {
      throw createHttpError(401, "Invalid key");
    }
    if (request.headers.token !== "456") {
      throw createHttpError(401, "Invalid token");
    }
    return { token: request.headers.token };
  },
});

// another example with logical OR
createMiddleware({
  security: {
    // requires either input and header OR bearer header
    or: [
      {
        and: [
          { type: "input", name: "key" },
          { type: "header", name: "token" },
        ],
      },
      {
        type: "bearer",
        format: "JWT",
      },
    ],
  },
  //...
});
```

### v7.6.3

- [@rayzr522](https://github.com/rayzr522) has fixed the resolution of types in the ESM build for the `nodenext` case.

### v7.6.2

- `zod` version is 3.17.10.

### v7.6.1

- Fixed issue #514: native express middlewares did not run for `OPTIONS` requests.
  - Using `.addExpressMiddleware()` or its alias `.use()` of `EndpointsFactory` it did not work for requests having
    `OPTIONS` method.
  - This version introduces the difference between a proprietary and native express middlewares.
    - Please ensure usage of the `.addMiddleware()` method along with `createMiddleware()`.
    - For the backward compatibility `.addMiddleware()` temporary also accepts the same arguments that
      `createMiddleware()` does, however this is deprecated and will be removed later.
  - Only native express middlewares are executed for `OPTIONS` request.
  - It makes it possible to use `cors` package (express middleware), which is described in the
    [Documentation](README.md#using-native-express-middlewares).
    - **Please note:** If using both `cors` package (express middleware) and `cors` configuration option, the
      configuration option sets CORS headers first, so the middleware can override them if needed.

```typescript
import { defaultEndpointsFactory } from "express-zod-api";
import cors from "cors";

const myFactory = defaultEndpointsFactory.addExpressMiddleware(
  cors({ credentials: true })
);
```

### v7.6.0

- `zod` version is 3.17.9.
  - Some new public methods have been introduced, so I'm changing the minor version.

### v7.5.0

- Feature #503: configurable CORS headers.
  - The configuration options `cors` now accepts a function that returns custom headers.
  - The function may be asynchronous.
  - Setting `cors: true` implies the default headers.

```typescript
import { createConfig } from "express-zod-api";

const config = createConfig({
  // ...
  cors: ({ defaultHeaders, request, endpoint, logger }) => ({
    ...defaultHeaders,
    "Access-Control-Max-Age": "5000",
  }),
});
```

```yaml
# the default headers are:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: ..., OPTIONS # endpoint methods + OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: content-type
```

### v7.4.1

- There was an issue with logger when calling its methods without a message.
  The output was empty, considering the first argument to be a message.
  It's fixed in this version by adding `[No message]` message before printing the object.

```typescript
// reproduction example
logger.debug({ something: "test" });
```

### v7.4.0

- `winston` version is 3.8.1.

### v7.3.1

- `zod-to-ts` version is 1.1.1.
  - descriptions of the properties in the generated client.

### v7.3.0

- `express-fileupload` version is 1.4.0.
  - `busboy` upgraded from 0.3.1 to 1.6.0.
- `zod` version is 3.17.3.

### v7.2.0

- `zod` version is 3.17.2.
  - `z.string()` schema now has `.trim()` method.

### v7.1.1

- `zod` version is 3.16.1.

### v7.1.0

- Supporting Node 18.

### v7.0.0

- The deprecated methods and utility types have been removed:
  - `markOutput(), EndpointInput<>, EndpointOutput<>, EndpointResponse<>`.
- In case you've been using these entities for informing the Frontend on types of your endpoints, here is what you
  need to do in order to migrate:
  - Replace `markOutput(output)` with just `output` in your custom result handlers;
  - Replace the type signature of `getPositiveResponse()` method of your custom result handlers:
    - from `getPositiveResponse: <OUT extends IOSchema>(output: OUT) => {...}`
    - to `getPositiveResponse: (output: IOSchema) => {...}`
  - Replace usage of the utility types to the generated Frontend Client:
    - See Readme file on how to do it.

## Version 6

### v6.2.1

- `zod` version is 3.16.0.

### v6.2.0

- The following methods and utility types have been marked as deprecated:
  - `markOutput()`,
  - `EndpointInput<>`,
  - `EndpointOutput<>`,
  - `EndpointResponse<>`.
- These entities were used for informing the Frontend on types of API endpoints.
- Instead, consider the new approach on generating a Frontend Client (see Readme).

### v6.1.4

- `zod` version is 3.15.1.

### v6.1.3

- `express` version is 4.18.1.
- `zod-to-ts` version is 1.0.1.

### v6.1.2

- `express` version is 4.18.0.
  - Various new options and fixes.
- `zod-to-ts` version is 1.0.0.
  - The type of optional I/O parameters in the generated Client is aligned with `zod` definition.

```typescript
interface Before {
  foo: number | undefined;
}
interface After {
  foo?: number | undefined; // the question mark added
}
```

### v6.1.1

- Hotfix: capitalizing the method in example implementation (Client generator).

### v6.1.0

- Feature #403: API Client Generator.
  - A new way of informing the frontend about the I/O types of endpoints.
  - The new approach offers automatic generation of a client based on routing to a typescript file.
  - The generated client is flexibly configurable on the frontend side using an implementation function that
    directly makes requests to an endpoint using the libraries and methods of your choice.
  - The client asserts the type of request parameters and response.
- Changes since `beta4`:
  - Add missing headers to example implementation.

```typescript
// example client-generator.ts
import fs from "fs";
import { Client } from "express-zod-api";

fs.writeFileSync("./frontend/client.ts", new Client(routing).print(), "utf-8");
```

```typescript
// example frontend using the most simple Implementation based on fetch
import { ExpressZodAPIClient } from "./client.ts";

const client = new ExpressZodAPIClient(async (method, path, params) => {
  const searchParams =
    method === "get" ? `?${new URLSearchParams(params)}` : "";
  const response = await fetch(`https://example.com${path}${searchParams}`, {
    method: method.toUpperCase(),
    headers:
      method === "get" ? undefined : { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: method === "get" ? undefined : JSON.stringify(params),
  });
  return response.json();
});

client.provide("get", "/v1/user/retrieve", { id: "10" });
```

### v6.1.0-beta4

- Path params are excluded from `params` after being substituted.

### v6.1.0-beta3

- The client now accepts a function parameter of `Implementation` type.
  - Its parameter `path` now contains substituted path params.

### v6.1.0-beta2

- Fixing bugs and taking into account path params.

### v6.1.0-beta1

- This is a beta release of a new feature for public testing.
- Feature #403: API Client Generator.
  - More details coming soon.

### v6.0.3

- `zod` version is 3.14.4.
- `winston` version is 3.7.2.

### v6.0.2

- `zod` version is 3.14.3.

### v6.0.1

- `zod` version is 3.14.2.

### v6.0.0

- Technically this version contains all the same changes and improvements as 5.9.0-beta1.
- The new implementation of the `EndpointsFactory`, however, has more restrictive middleware input schema requirements.
- To avoid possible backward incompatibility issues, I have decided to publish these changes as a major release.
- In addition, the deprecated schema `z.date()` is no longer supported in documentation generator.
- The following changes are required to migrate to this version:
  - You cannot use the `.strict()`, `.passthrough()` and its deprecated alias `.nonstrict()` methods in middlewares.
  - Only `.strip()` is allowed in middlewares, which is actually default, so you should not use any of them at all.
  - Replace the `z.date()` with `z.dateIn()` in input schema and with `z.dateOut()` in output schema.

```typescript
// how to migrate
export const myMiddleware = createMiddleware({
  input: z
    .object({
      key: z.string().nonempty(),
      at: z.date(), // <— replace with z.dateIn()
    })
    .passthrough(), // <— remove this if you have it in your code
  middleware: async () => ({...}),
});
```

## Version 5

### v5.9.0-beta1

- In this build, improvements have been made to the `EndpointsFactory`, in terms of combining the input schemas of
  middlewares and the endpoint itself. A custom type has been replaced with usage of `ZodIntersection` schema with
  respect to the originals.
- The generated documentation has improved in this regard:
  - Previously, fields from an object union were documented in a simplified way as optional.
  - Instead, it is now documented using `oneOf` OpenAPI notation.
- In addition, you can now also use the new `z.discriminatedUnion()` as the input schema on the top level.

```typescript
// example
const endpoint = defaultEndpointsFactory.build({
  method: "post",
  input: z.discriminatedUnion("type", [
    z.object({
      type: z.literal("text"),
      str: z.string()
    }),
    z.object({
      type: z.literal("numeric"),
      num: z.number()
    }),
  ]),
  output: z.object({...}),
  handler: async ({ input }) => {
    // the type of the input:
    // | { type: "text", str: string }
    // | { type: "numeric", num: number }
  }
});
```

### v5.8.0

- `zod` version is 3.13.4.
  - There is a new schema `z.nan()` and some fixes.

### v5.7.0

- `zod` version is 3.12.0.
  - There is a new schema `z.discriminatedUnion()` and various fixes.

### v5.6.1

- `express` version is 4.17.3.
- `openapi3-ts` version is 2.0.2.

### v5.6.0

- Feature #311. `EndpointsFactory::addExpressMiddleware()` or its alias `use()`.
  - A method to connect a native (regular) `express` middleware to your endpoint(s).
  - You can connect any middleware that has a regular express middleware signature
    `(req, res, next) => void | Promise<void>` and can be supplied to `app.use()`.
  - You can also specify a provider of options for endpoint handlers and next middlewares.
  - You can also specify an error transformer so that the `ResultHandler` would send the status you need.
    - In case the error is not a `HttpError`, the `ResultHandler` will send the status `500`.

```typescript
import { defaultEndpointsFactory, createHttpError } from "express-zod-api";
import cors from "cors";
import { auth } from "express-oauth2-jwt-bearer";

const simpleUsage = defaultEndpointsFactory.addExpressMiddleware(
  cors({ credentials: true })
);

const advancedUsage = defaultEndpointsFactory.use(auth(), {
  provider: (req) => ({ auth: req.auth }), // optional, can be async
  transformer: (err) => createHttpError(401, err.message), // optional
});
```

### v5.5.6

- `winston` version is 3.6.0.

### v5.5.5

- `winston-transport` version is 4.5.0.

### v5.5.4

- `express-fileupload` version is 1.3.1.

### v5.5.3

- `winston` version is 3.5.1.
- I made a website for the library available on following domains:
  - [https://ez.robintail.cz](https://ez.robintail.cz) and
  - [https://express-zod-api.vercel.app](https://express-zod-api.vercel.app).
  - Currently, it provides the documentation for each release in a way I find more suitable.

### v5.5.2

- `winston` version is 3.5.0.

### v5.5.1

- In this version, the OpenAPI documentation generator throws an error when using `z.upload()` within response schema.

### v5.5.0

- No changes.

### v5.5.0-beta1

- `z.date()` is deprecated for using within IO schemas of your API.
- Feature #297: `z.dateIn()` and `z.dateOut()` schemas.
  - Since `Date` cannot be passed directly in JSON format, attempting to return `Date` from the endpoint handler
    results in it being converted to an ISO `string` in actual response. It is also impossible to transmit the `Date`
    in its original form to your endpoints within JSON. Therefore, there is confusion with original method `z.date()`.
  - In order to solve this problem, the library provides two custom methods for dealing with dates: `z.dateIn()` and
    `z.dateOut()` for using within input and output schemas accordingly.
  - `z.dateIn()` is a transforming schema that accepts an ISO `string` representation of a `Date`, validates it, and
    provides your endpoint handler or middleware with a `Date`.
  - `z.dateOut()`, on the contrary, accepts a `Date` and provides `ResultHanlder` with a `string` representation in ISO
    format for the response transmission.

```typescript
import { z, defaultEndpointsFactory } from "express-zod-api";

const updateUserEndpoint = defaultEndpointsFactory.build({
  method: "post",
  input: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    birthday: z.dateIn(), // string -> Date
  }),
  output: z.object({
    createdAt: z.dateOut(), // Date -> string
  }),
  handler: async ({ input }) => {
    // input.birthday is Date
    return {
      // transmitted as "2022-01-22T00:00:00.000Z"
      createdAt: new Date("2022-01-22"),
    };
  },
});
```

### v5.4.2

- `ramda` version is 0.28.0.
- The header `X-Powered-By: Express` has been removed according to
  [recommendations](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html).

### v5.4.1

- No changes.

### v5.4.1-beta1

- Listing the following types as the regular dependencies since certain exported methods refer to them:
  `@types/compression, @types/express, @types/express-fileupload, @types/http-errors, @types/node`.
- Here is the information that underlies this decision:
  - https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/publishing.html#dependencies
  - https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/44777#issuecomment-629660992

### v5.4.0

- Feature #281: Response compression.
  - You can enable and configure the response compression using the new option `compression` in server configuration
    when using `createServer()` method.
  - In order to receive the compressed response the client should include the following header in the request:
    `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`.
  - Only responses with compressible content types are subject to compression.
  - There is also a default threshold of 1KB that can be configured.

```typescript
import { createConfig } from "express-zod-api";

const config = createConfig({
  server: {
    // enabling and configuring the compression: bool or options
    compression: {
      threshold: "100b",
    },
    // other options
  },
});
```

### v5.3.3

- `ramda` version is 0.27.2.
- `winston` version is 3.4.0.
  - The version of dependent package `colors` has been strictly set to 1.4.0.
  - More about this incident here: https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/pull/2008

### v5.3.2

- No changes.

### v5.3.1

- Fixed issue #269: async refinements in I/O schemas of endpoints and middlewares.
  - There was an error `Async refinement encountered during synchronous parse operation. Use .parseAsync instead.`

### v5.3.0

- Supporting Node 17.

### v5.2.1

- Fixing the compatibility with `@types/node@17.0.7`.
  - Fixing the return type of `Endpoint::execute()` in case of `OPTIONS` method (it should be `void`).

### v5.2.0

- Feature #254: the ability to configure routes for serving static files.
  - Use `new ServeStatic()` with the same arguments as `express.static()`.
  - You can find the documentation on these arguments here: http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#express.static

```typescript
import { Routing, ServeStatic } from "express-zod-api";
import path from "path";

const routing: Routing = {
  // path /public serves static files from ./assets
  public: new ServeStatic(path.join(__dirname, "assets"), {
    dotfiles: "deny",
    index: false,
    redirect: false,
  }),
};
```

### v5.1.0

- No changes.

### v5.1.0-beta2

- Fixing a warning message when using `testEndpoint()` method.

### v5.1.0-beta1

- Feature #252: a helper method for testing your endpoints: `testEndpoint()`.
  - Requires `jest` (and optionally `@types/jest`) to be installed.
  - The method helps to mock the request, response, config and logger required to execute the endpoint.
  - The method executes the endpoint and returns the created mocks.
  - After that you only need to assert your expectations in the test.

```typescript
import { testEndpoint } from "express-zod-api";

test("should respond successfully", async () => {
  const { responseMock, loggerMock } = await testEndpoint({
    endpoint: yourEndpoint,
    requestProps: {
      method: "POST",
      body: { ... },
    },
  });
  expect(loggerMock.error).toBeCalledTimes(0);
  expect(responseMock.status).toBeCalledWith(200);
  expect(responseMock.json).toBeCalledWith({
    status: "success",
    data: { ... },
  });
});
```

### v5.0.0

- No changes.

### v5.0.0-beta1

- The ability to configure and run an additional HTTPS server to process requests over a secure protocol.
- This option is only available when using `createServer()` method.
- **Breaking changes**: Instead of HTTP Server the method `createServer()` now returns an object with the following
  entities: `app, httpServer, httpsServer, logger`.
- New configuration option `https`:

```typescript
import { createConfig } from "express-zod-api";

const config = createConfig({
  server: {
    listen: 80,
  },
  // enables HTTPS server as well
  https: {
    // at least "cert" and "key" options required
    options: {
      cert: fs.readFileSync("fullchain.pem", "utf-8"),
      key: fs.readFileSync("privkey.pem", "utf-8"),
    },
    listen: 443, // port or socket
  },
  // ...
});
```

## Version 4

### v4.2.0

- `express` version is 4.17.2.
- `http-errors` version is 2.0.0.

### v4.1.0

- Feature #230. The shorthand method `EndpointsFactory::addOptions()`.
  - You may find it useful in case you'd like to provide your Endpoint's handler with some entities that do not depend
    on Request, maybe a database connection instance of similar.
  - Under the hood the method creates a middleware with an empty input and attaches it to the factory.
  - The argument supplied to the method is available within `options` parameter of the Endpoint's `handler`.

```typescript
import { defaultEndpointsFactory } from "express-zod-api";

const newFactory = defaultEndpointsFactory.addOptions({
  db: mongoose.connect("mongodb://connection.string"),
  privateKey: fs.readFileSync("private-key.pem", "utf-8"),
});

const endpoint = newFactory.build({
  method: "get",
  input: z.object({}),
  output: z.object({}),
  handler: async ({ options }) => {
    return {}; // options: { db, privateKey }
  },
});
```

### v4.0.0

- The deprecated parameter `type` of `EndpointsFactory::build({...})` has been removed.
- The OpenAPI generator now requires `config` parameter to be supplied in `new OpenAPI({...})`.
- The OpenAPI generator takes into account possibly customized `inputSources` from `config`.

## Version 3

### v3.2.0

- Feature #204. Detecting usage of `z.upload()` within Endpoint's input schema automatically.
  - There is no longer need to specify `type: "upload"` for `EndpointsFactory::build({...})`.
  - In case you are using `z.upload()` in endpoint's input schema, inputs will be parsed by the
    `multipart/form-data` parser.
  - The optional parameter `type?: "json" | "upload"` of `build({...})` is deprecated.

### v3.1.2

- Fixed issue #202, originally reported in PR #201.
  - Using curly braces notation instead of colon for route path params in generated documentation according to
    OpenAPI / Swagger specification.
  - See "Path templating" at https://swagger.io/specification/.

```yaml
# before
/v1/user/:id:
# after
"/v1/user/{id}":
```

### v3.1.1

- No changes. Releasing as 3.1.1 due to a typo in Readme I found after publishing 3.1.0.

### v3.1.0

- Feature #174: Route path params as the new input source.
  - `request.params` is validated against the input schema.
  - The schema for validating the path params can now be described along with other inputs.
  - You no longer need a middleware like `paramsProviderMiddleware` to handle path params.
  - The route path params are now reflected in the generated documentation.

```typescript
const routingExample: Routing = {
  v1: {
    user: {
      // route path /v1/user/:id, where :id is the path param
      ":id": getUserEndpoint,
    },
  },
};
const getUserEndpoint = endpointsFactory.build({
  method: "get",
  input: withMeta(
    z.object({
      // id is the route path param, always string
      id: z.string().transform((value) => parseInt(value, 10)),
      // other inputs (in query):
      withExtendedInformation: z.boolean().optional(),
    })
  ).example({
    id: "12",
    withExtendedInformation: true,
  }),
  // ...
});
```

- The default configuration of `inputSources` has been changed.

```typescript
const newInputSourcesByDefault: InputSources = {
  get: ["query", "params"],
  post: ["body", "params", "files"],
  put: ["body", "params"],
  patch: ["body", "params"],
  delete: ["body", "query", "params"],
};
```

### v3.0.0

- No changes. [November 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_Day_of_Remembrance) release.

### v3.0.0-beta2

- No changes. Compiled using the recently released Typescript 4.5.2.

### v3.0.0-beta1

- **Warning**: There are breaking changes described below:
  - Minimum compatible Node version changed from ~~10~~ to 12.
  - The exports map restricts the possibility to import/require the package files to the entry points only.
  - The deprecated type `ConfigType` removed — please use `createConfig()` instead.
- The library is now distributed as a dual package containing both CJS (CommonJS) and ESM (ECMAScript Module).
- Mime version is 3.0.0.

## Version 2

### v2.10.2

- The version of http-errors is 1.8.1.

### v2.10.1

- Mime version is 2.6.0.
- Minor fix in importing Zod utility type.

### v2.10.0

- Feature #165. You can add examples to the generated documentation.
  - Introducing new method `withMeta()`. You can wrap any Zod schema in it, for example: `withMeta(z.string())`.
  - `withMeta()` provides you with additional methods for generated documentation. At the moment there is one so far:
    `withMeta().example()`.
  - You can use `.example()` multiple times for specifying several examples for your schema.
  - You can specify example for the whole IO schema or just for a one of its properties.
  - `withMeta()` can be used within Endpoint and Middleware as well. Their input examples will be merged for the
    generated documentation.
  - Check out the example of the generated documentation in the `example` folder.
  - Notice: `withMeta()` mutates its argument.

```typescript
import { defaultEndpointsFactory } from "express-zod-api";

const exampleEndpoint = defaultEndpointsFactory.build({
  method: "post",
  description: "example user update endpoint",
  input: withMeta(
    z.object({
      id: z.number().int().nonnegative(),
      name: z.string().nonempty(),
    })
  ).example({
    id: 12,
    name: "John Doe",
  }),
  output: withMeta(
    z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      timestamp: z.number().int().nonnegative(),
    })
  ).example({
    name: "John Doe",
    timestamp: 1235698995125,
  }),
  handler: async () => {},
});
```

### v2.9.0

- Zod version is 3.11.6.
- Feature #111. You can add description to any Zod schema, for example: `z.string().describe('Something')`.
  - You can add description to a whole I/O schema or its property.
  - This description will be included into the generated Swagger / OpenAPI documentation.

```yaml
example:
  parameters:
    - name: id
      in: query
      required: true
      schema:
        description: a numeric string containing the id of the user
        type: string
        pattern: /\d+/
```

### v2.8.2

- Zod version is 3.10.3.

### v2.8.1

- Fixed issue #169. Suddenly I found out that `yarn` does NOT respect `yarn.lock` files of sub-dependencies. So the
  version of `zod` defined in my `yarn.lock` file does not actually mean anything when doing `yarn add express-zod-api`.
  - The recently released version of Zod (3.10.x) seems to have some breaking changes, it should not be installed
    according to my lock file.
  - I'm locking the dependency versions in `package.json` file from now on.
  - `npm` users are also affected since the distributed lock file is for `yarn`.

### v2.8.0

- I did my best in order to improve the documentation and list the recently implemented features.
- Feature #158: ability to specify the input sources for each request method.
- New config option `inputSources` allows you to specify the properties of the request, that are combined into an
  input that is being validated and available to your endpoints and middlewares.

```typescript
import { createConfig } from "express-zod-api";

createConfig({
  // ...,
  inputSources: {
    // the default value is:
    get: ["query"],
    post: ["body", "files"],
    put: ["body"],
    patch: ["body"],
    delete: ["query", "body"],
  },
});
```

- For example, in case you need `query` along with `body` available to your endpoints handling POST requests, consider:

```typescript
createConfig({
  // ...,
  inputSources: {
    post: ["query", "body", "files"],
  },
});
```

- The order in array matters: last item has the highest priority in case of the same name properties.

### v2.7.0

- From now on, I want to express my support to trans people in the IT world.
  Transgender rights are human rights and all human beings are born free and equal in dignity.
  I believe that the problem of discrimination against the rights of trans people is not visible enough,
  so I add startup logo in this regard.
- However, you can turn it off with a simple setting:

```typescript
import {createConfig} from 'express-zod-api';

const config = createConfig({
  startupLogo: false,
  ...
});
```

### v2.6.0

- Zod version is 3.9.8.
  - It supports the ability to specify the key schema of `z.record()`.
  - In case of using enums and literals in the key schema they will be described as required ones in the generated
    OpenAPI / Swagger documentation.

```typescript
// example
z.record(
  z.enum(["option1", "option2"]), // keys
  z.boolean() // values
);
```

- Feature #145: `attachRouting()` now returns the `logger` instance and `notFoundHandler`. You can use it with your
  custom express app for handling `404` (not found) errors:

```typescript
const { notFoundHandler } = attachRouting(config, routing);
app.use(notFoundHandler);
app.listen();
```

- Or you can use the `logger` instance with any `ResultHandler` for the same purpose:

```typescript
const { logger } = attachRouting(config, routing);
app.use((request, response) => {
  defaultResultHandler.handler({
    request,
    response,
    logger,
    error: createHttpError(404, `${request.path} not found`),
    input: null,
    output: null,
  });
});
app.listen();
```

### v2.5.2

- Fixed a bug due to which the API did not respond in case of an error within the `ResultHandler`.
  - In this case the `LastResortHandler` comes into play.
  - It sets the status code to `500` and sends out plain text with an error message.
  - It is not customizable yet, and it's meant to be kept very simple in case of JSON conversion errors.

### v2.5.1

- Fixed a bug due to which the execution of the code could continue despite the possible closing of the response
  stream by one of the middlewares.
  - Affected Node versions: below 12.9.0.

### v2.5.0

- New feature: file uploads!
- The processing of files is provided by `express-fileupload` which is based on `busboy`.
- Introducing the new schema: `z.upload()`.
- New configuration option:

```typescript
const config = createConfig({
  server: {
    upload: true,
    // or selected express-fileupload's options:
    // @see https://github.com/richardgirges/express-fileupload#available-options
    upload: {
      uploadTimeout: 60000,
      useTempFiles: true,
      safeFileNames: true,
      preserveExtension: 4,
      tempFileDir: "/var/tmp",
    },
  },
});
```

- Creating the `Endpoint`:

```typescript
const fileUploadEndpoint = defaultEndpointsFactory.build({
  method: "post",
  type: "upload", // <- new option, required
  input: z.object({
    avatar: z.upload(),
  }),
  output: z.object({
    /* ... */
  }),
  handler: async ({ input: { avatar } }) => {
    // avatar: {name, mv(), mimetype, encoding, data, truncated, size, etc}
    // avatar.truncated is true on failure
    return {
      /* ... */
    };
  },
});
```

- The file upload currently supports requests having POST method and `multipart/form-data` content type.
- You can send other data and specify additional `input` parameters, including arrays and objects.
- Fixed the OPTIONS duplication issue in response header when `cors` option is enabled:

```http request
# before
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS, OPTIONS
# after
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS
```

### v2.4.0

- Zod version is 3.8.2.
- Supporting new string format: `cuid`.
- Supporting new Zod schema `z.preprocess()`.
  Please avoid using it for Endpoint outputs.
- Supporting default values of optional properties in OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.

```typescript
// example
z.object({
  name: z.string().optional().default("John Wick"),
});
```

### v2.3.3

- Zod version is 3.7.3.
- Removed usage of the deprecated `ZodObject`'s method `.nonstrict()` in the example and Readme since it's not required.

### v2.3.2

- Zod version is 3.7.2.
- I've also updated it to `^3.7.2` in the `package.json` file in case of package manager issues.

### v2.3.1

- Fixed a type mismatch issue when the configuration is declared in a separate file using the `ConfigType`.
  - `ConfigType` is now deprecated _(will be removed in v3)_.
  - Please use helper function `createConfig()`.
  - This way it assigns the correct type for using configuration with `createServer()` and `attachRouting()`.

```typescript
// before
const configBefore: ConfigType = {
  server: {
    listen: 8090,
  },
  cors: true,
  logger: {
    level: "debug",
    color: true,
  },
};
// after
export const configAfter = createConfig({
  server: {
    listen: 8090,
  },
  cors: true,
  logger: {
    level: "debug",
    color: true,
  },
});
```

### v2.3.0

- Changes and improvements of the generated Swagger / OpenAPI documentation:

```yaml
ZodArray: # z.array()
  before:
    type: array
    items:
      type: type # type of the array items
  after:
    type: array
    items:
      type: type
    minItems: value # optional, when z.array().min(value)
    maxItems: value # optional, when z.array().max(value)
ZodTuple: # z.tuple()
  before:
    error: unsupported
  after:
    type: array
    items:
      oneOf: [] # schemas of the tuple items
    minItems: value # number of items in the tuple
    maxItems: value # number of items in the tuple
    description: "0: type, 1: type, etc"
```

### v2.2.0

- Changes and improvements of the generated Swagger / OpenAPI documentation:

```yaml
ZodBigInt: # z.bigint()
  before:
    type: integer
    format: int64
  after:
    type: integer
    format: bigint
ZodNumber: # z.number()
  before:
    type: number
  after:
    type: number | integer # when z.number().int()
    format: double | int64 # when z.number().int()
    # MIN_VALUE or MIN_SAFE_INTEGER of Number or z.number().min(value)
    minimum: 5e-324 | -9007199254740991 | value
    # MAX_VALUE or MAX_SAFE_INTEGER of Number or z.number().max(value)
    maximum: 1.7976931348623157e+308 | 9007199254740991 | value
    # Taking into account z.number().min(), .max(), .positive(), .nonnegative(), etc
    exclusiveMinimum: true | false
    exclusiveMaximum: true | false
ZodString: # z.string()
  before:
    type: string
  after:
    type: string
    minLength: value # optional, when z.string().min(value)
    maxLength: value # optional, when z.string().max(value)
    format: email | uuid | url # when z.string().email(), .uuid(), .url()
    pattern: /your regular expression/ # when z.string().regex(value)
```

- Since `z.number().int()` is a
  [JS Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) which is
  neither `int32` nor `int64` but rather `int53`, I made a decision to describe it as `int64` predefined `format` with
  an indispensable minimum and maximum values.

### v2.1.1

- Fixed issue [#92](https://github.com/RobinTail/express-zod-api/issues/92): The error
  `Cannot convert undefined or null to object` in OpenAPI generator when using `z.record()` type has been fixed.
- Supporting type `z.any()` in OpenAPI generator.

### v2.1.0

- Zod version is 3.7.1.
- New response schema type `ZodFile` can be created using `z.file()`. It has two refinements: `.binary()` and
  `.base64()` which also reflected in the generated Swagger / OpenAPI documentation.
  You can use it instead of `z.string()` with `createApiResponse()`:

```typescript
// before
const fileStreamingEndpointsFactoryBefore = new EndpointsFactory(
  createResultHandler({
    getPositiveResponse: () => createApiResponse(z.string(), "image/*"),
    // ...,
  })
);

// after
const fileStreamingEndpointsFactoryAfter = new EndpointsFactory(
  createResultHandler({
    getPositiveResponse: () => createApiResponse(z.file().binary(), "image/*"),
    // ...,
  })
);
```

- Please do NOT use `z.file()` within the `Endpoint` input / output object schemas.

### v2.0.0

- First stable release of the v2.
- All dependencies are up to date.
- Minor changes of response descriptions in OpenAPI / Swagger documentation generator.

### v2.0.0-beta4

- The code has not been changed from the previous version.
- I've added the [Security policy](https://github.com/RobinTail/express-zod-api/blob/master/SECURITY.md).
- The last thing that still confuses me is the naming of the `getPositiveResponse` and `getNegativeResponse` properties
  of `ResultHandlerDefinition`. The first of which has to be a method, since it depends on the output of the `Endpoint`,
  and the second, although it shouldn't, I made it this way for consistency.
- In any case, my idea for a stable release of the second version in a week has now been formed, but if you have any
  feedback, suggestions, recommendations, complaints, please let me know. I've added a
  [section](https://github.com/RobinTail/express-zod-api#your-input-to-my-output) to the Readme file on how to do this.

### v2.0.0-beta3

- Some private methods have been made "really private" using the new typescript hashtag syntax.
- Fixed `EndpointOutput<>` type helper for the non-object response type in the `ResultHandlerDefinition`.

### v2.0.0-beta2

- Zod version is 3.5.1.
- Better examples including a custom `ResultHandler` and a file download.
- Fixed a bug of incorrect `getPositiveMimeTypes()` and `getNegativeMimeTypes()` usage in Swagger docs generator.

### v2.0.0-beta1

- **Warning**: There are breaking changes described below.
  In general, if you used the `defaultResultHandler` before, then you won't have to change much of code.
- **Motivation**. I really like the first version of the library for its simplicity and elegance,
  but there is one imperfection in it. The available methods and type helpers do not allow to disclose the complete
  response of the endpoint, including the specification of a successful and error response for which the
  `ResultHandler` is responsible. So I decided to fix it, although it made the implementation somewhat more
  complicated, but I found it important. However, it brought a number of benefits, which are also described below.
- Node version required: at least `10.0.0` and the library target now is `ES6`.
- Type `ResultHandler` is no longer exported, please use `createResultHandler()` or `defaultResultHandler`.
- The `setResultHandler()` method of `EndpointsFactory` class has been removed. The `ResultHandlerDefinition` has
  to be specified as an argument of `EndpointsFactory` constructor. You can use `defaultResultHandler` or
  `createResultHandler()` for this, or you can use `defaultEndpointsFactory`.

```typescript
// before
export const endpointsFactoryBefore = new EndpointsFactory();
// after
export const endpointsFactoryAfter = new EndpointsFactory(defaultResultHandler);
// which is the same as
import { defaultEndpointsFactory } from "express-zod-api";
```

- The optional property `resultHandler` of `ConfigType` has been replaced with `errorHandler`.

```typescript
// before
resultHandler: ResultHandler; // optional
// after
errorHandler: ResultHandlerDefinition<any, any>; // optional, default: defaultResultHandler
```

- New methods of `Endpoint` class `getPositiveResponseSchema()` and `getNegativeResponseSchema()` return the
  complete response of the endpoint taking into account the `ResultHandlerDefinition` schemas.
  New methods: `getPositiveMimeTypes()` and `getNegativeMimeTypes()` return the array of mime types.
- New type helping utility: `EndpointResponse<E extends AbstractEndpoint>` to be used instead of `EndpointOutput`
  returns the complete type of the endpoint response including both positive and negative cases.

```typescript
// Example. Before (v1):
import { EndpointOutput } from "express-zod-api";

const myEndpointV1 = endpointsFactory.build({
  method: "get",
  input: z.object({
    /* ... */
  }),
  output: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
  }),
  handler: async () => ({
    /* ... */
  }),
});
type MyEndpointOutput = EndpointOutput<typeof myEndpointV1>; // => { name: string }

// and after (v2):
import { defaultEndpointsFactory, EndpointResponse } from "express-zod-api";

const myEndpointV2 = defaultEndpointsFactory.build({
  method: "get",
  input: z.object({
    /* ... */
  }),
  output: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
  }),
  handler: async () => ({
    /* ... */
  }),
});
type MyEndpointResponse = EndpointResponse<typeof myEndpointV2>; // => the following type:
//  {
//    status: 'success';
//    data: { name: string };
//  } | {
//    status: 'error',
//    error: { message: string };
//  }
```

- Obtaining the OpenAPI / Swagger specification has been simplified: now you can call `getSpecAsYaml()` method
  directly on `OpenAPI` class instance. There is also a new option `errorResponseDescription`.

```typescript
// before
new OpenAPI({
  /* ... */
}).builder.getSpecAsYaml();
// after
new OpenAPI({
  /* ... */
}).getSpecAsYaml();
```

- OpenAPI / Swagger specification no longer uses references for schemas and parameters, so they are inline now.
  Instead of `default` entry in `responses` there are HTTP status codes `200` and `400` that represent positive
  and negative responses accordingly. Response schemas are now complete as well.
- For creating your own `ResultHandlerDefinition` please use `createResultHandler()`. It also requires
  `createApiResponse()` to be used that takes a response schema and optional mime types as arguments.
  The endpoint output should be wrapped in `markOutput()`. So far this is the only way I have come up with to
  facilitate type inference with essentially double nesting of generic types. Typescript does not yet support such
  features as `MyGenericType<A<B>>`.

```typescript
// before
const myResultHandlerV1: ResultHandler = ({
  error,
  request,
  response,
  input,
  output,
  logger,
}) => {
  /* ... */
};
// after
const myResultHandlerV2 = createResultHandler({
  getPositiveResponse: <OUT extends IOSchema>(output: OUT) =>
    createApiResponse(
      z.object({
        // ...,
        someProperty: markOutput(output),
      }),
      ["mime/type1", "mime/type2"] // optional, default: application/json
    ),
  getNegativeResponse: () =>
    createApiResponse(
      z.object({
        /* ... */
      })
    ),
  handler: ({ error, input, output, request, response, logger }) => {
    /* ... */
  },
});
```

## Version 1

### v1.3.1

- Improving the coverage I found a bug and fixed it.
  In some cases there was an issue with CORS requests: [preflight OPTIONS requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#preflighted_requests).
  Despite the enabled configuration option `cors: true` the OPTIONS requests have not been handled properly.
  This was leading to the 404 error with a message "Can not OPTIONS \<route\>".
  The issue has been fixed and covered by multiple tests.

### v1.3.0

- Zod version is 3.2.0.
- Minor changes to logging internal server errors.

### v1.2.1

- Additional handling of keys in `Routing` objects.
- `createServer`, `attachRouting` and `new OpenAPI()` may throw an Error in case of using slashes in `Routing` keys.

### v1.2.0

- Ability to specify the endpoint description and [export it to the Swagger / OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/RobinTail/express-zod-api#swagger--openapi-specification).

```typescript
// example
const endpoint = endpointsFactory.build({
  description: "Here is an example description of the endpoint",
  // ...,
});
```

- Ability to specify either `methods` or `method` property to `.build()`. This is just a more convenient way for a single method case.

```typescript
// example
const endpoint = endpointsFactory.build({
  method: "get", // same as methods:['get'] before
  // ...,
});
```

- Ability for a route to have multiple Endpoints attached depending on different methods.
  It can also be the same Endpoint that handle multiple methods as well.
  This is a solution for the question raised in issue [#29](https://github.com/RobinTail/express-zod-api/issues/29).

```typescript
// example of different I/O schemas for /v1/user
const routing: Routing = {
  v1: {
    user: new DependsOnMethod({
      get: myEndpointForGetAndDelete,
      delete: myEndpointForGetAndDelete,
      post: myEndpointForPostAndPatch,
      patch: myEndpointForPostAndPatch,
    }),
  },
};
```

### v1.1.0

- Zod version is v3.1.0.

### v1.0.0

- First version based on the stable Zod release.
- Zod version is v3.0.2.
- Other dependencies has been upgraded to the latest versions as well.

## Version 0

### v0.7.2

- Readme file updates:
  - Transformations
  - `ResultHandler`
  - better examples

### v0.7.1

- Readme file updates:
  - Concept description update.
  - Excess property check according to the new features of version 0.7.0.
- Refactoring of `defaultResultHandler` and `ResultHandler` calls in `server.ts`.

### v0.7.0

- Zod version is v3.0.0-beta.1.
- Ability to use z.ZodIntersection and z.ZodUnion as an I/O schema for handlers and middlewares.

```typescript
// example
const middleware = createMiddleware({
  input: z
    .object({
      one: z.string(),
    })
    .or(
      z.object({
        two: z.number(),
      })
    ),
  middleware: async ({ input }) => ({
    input, // => type: { one: string } | { two: number }
  }),
});
```

- Ability to use `z.transform()` in handler's output schema.

```typescript
// example
const endpoint = factory.build({
  methods: ["post"],
  input: z.object({}),
  output: z.object({
    value: z.string().transform((str) => str.length),
  }),
  handler: async ({ input, options }) => ({
    value: "test", // => in response: { value: 4 }
  }),
});
```

- Supplying parameters to `EndpointsFactory::constructor()` is now prohibited. Please use `.addMiddleware()` and `.setResultHandler()` as the right way in order to achieve the correct input schema type in handlers.

### v0.6.1

- Nothing special. Just new logo and the dataflow diagram update.

### v0.6.0

- OpenAPI / Swagger specification generator now supports `ZodNullable`, `ZodOptional`, `ZodUnion` and `ZodIntersection` properties.

### v0.5.0

- `ConfigType` changes:

```typescript
// before
export interface ConfigType {
  server: {
    listen: number | string;
    cors: boolean;
    jsonParser?: NextHandleFunction;
    resultHandler?: ResultHandler;
  };
  logger: LoggerConfig | winston.Logger;
}

// after
export type ConfigType = (
  | {
      server: {
        // server configuration
        listen: number | string; // preserved
        jsonParser?: NextHandleFunction; // preserved
      };
    }
  | {
      // or your custom express app
      app: Express;
    }
) & {
  cors: boolean; // moved
  resultHandler?: ResultHandler; // moved
  logger: LoggerConfig | Logger;
};
```

- More convenient way to attach routing to your custom express app:

```typescript
// before
initRouting({ app, logger, config, routing });
// after
const config: ConfigType = { app /* ..., */ };
attachRouting(config, routing);
```

### v0.4.1

- Minor Readme file fixes and clarifications.
- Nice dataflow diagram.

### v0.4.0

- Ability to specify your custom Winston logger in config.
- `createLogger()` now accepts `LoggerConfig` as an argument:

```typescript
// before
createLogger(config);
// after
createLogger(config.logger);
```

### v0.3.1

- Minor Readme file fixes and clarifications.

### v0.3.0

- Zod version is v3.0.0-alpha33.
- The syntax for generating the Swagger/OpenAPI specification has changed:

```typescript
// before

```

### v0.2.4
